# Sensitive text filter

The project is a demo of how to use deterministic finite automata (DFA) to filter out sensitive content from a text based on provided sensitive text.


## Features

- **Customizable Sensitive Word List**: Manage and update the list of sensitive words according to your specific requirements.
- **Efficient Content Scanning**: Quickly scans text inputs and identifies sensitive content using an optimized deterministic finite automaton (DFA) based algorithm.
- **History Tracking**: Maintains a history of all scans, including detected sensitive words and the complete text.
